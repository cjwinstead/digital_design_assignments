\begin{enumerate}
\item Create a shared folder in virtual box (https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-share-folders-between-guest-and-host-in-virtualbox/). Make sure to select auto-mount. 

\item Download xdc file to shared folder. Then 
include it in the project.

\item Booting order: power on host machine $\rightarrow$ power on virtualbox instanace $\rightarrow$ plug in the Basys3 board $\rightarrow$ power off virtualbox instance
$\rightarrow$ unplug in the Basys3 board
$\rightarrow$ power off host machine
$\rightarrow$ remove the ECE external drive.

\item Add xdc file to the decoders for lab 4

\item Bug found by Chris Winstead: I experienced a bug testing Vivado today. The fix is simple, and you may want to advise your students to take these steps:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Launch Vivado, create a project
    \item In the top menu bar, select Tools->Text Editor, then Syntax Checking
    \item Change from “sigasi” to “vivado”
    \item Restart Vivado
\end{enumerate}
For some reason the sigasi checker crashes sometimes.

\item Maybe we should make a tip sheet for using the drive; using a shared folder is a good idea for several reasons, also it’s good to see that the students’ files can be recovered from the shared folder even if the vdi file is lost.
